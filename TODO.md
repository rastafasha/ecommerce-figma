# Task: Resolve React Native Version Mismatch Error on iOS

## Plan Breakdown
1. [ ] Clear Caches and Reset Bundler: Run commands to clear Watchman, Metro, and node caches, then start Expo with --clear for iOS. Watchman not installed (skipped). Keeping Expo SDK 54/RN 0.81.4 as requested. Fixed peer deps in devDependencies. Node v20.18.3 (minor version warning, but install succeeded with --legacy-peer-deps). node_modules reinstalled successfully. Now clearing caches and testing start.
2. [ ] Clean iOS-Specific Builds: If Step 1 fails, clear Xcode DerivedData and run expo run:ios --clear.
3. [x] Fix Dependencies: Updated devDeps (@types/react ~19.1.10, eslint-config-expo ~10.0.0, typescript ~5.9.2) to resolve ERESOLVE for Expo 54. Cleared and reinstalled node_modules with --legacy-peer-deps (success, 0 vulnerabilities).
4. [ ] Rebuild and Test: Clear caches, run npx expo start --clear --ios; verify no mismatch error.
5. [x] Check Node.js Version: Confirmed v20.18.3; compatible enough (warnings for 20.19.4+, but proceeded).

## Progress Notes
- EBADENGINE warnings noted (Node <20.19.4 for RN 0.81.4); consider upgrading Node to 20.19+ if issues persist.
- Awaiting test results.
